                                    then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
                                    Grade is A if score is >=  bestScore - 5;
                                    Grade is B if score is >=  bestScore - 10;
                                    Grade is C if score is >=  bestScore - 15;
                                    Grade is D if score is >=  bestScore - 20;
                                    Grade is F otherwise.
                                    The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, and then
                                    prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.
